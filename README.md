# Climate Model Animation
This is the source code for the final project in my geoscience/environmental studies class. [This is the final project](https://youtu.be/IpjenHinSiQ) in video form. 
It uses a python library called manim, whose documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).
